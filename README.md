## Introduction 
Hi my name is Daniil, I am a developer specializing in different technologies, one of them is  Construct 2. I worked for Construct 2 Mentor for 4 years and here I will show you several of my projects.

## Important
Many of my projects are not my private property, I have sold them, that is why in this repo you will see not one game from tutorial or official Construct documentation, however I upgraded functionality for this projects. 

## Stack of technologies
* [![Construct][Construct]][Construct-url]
* [![JavaScript][JavaScript]][JavaScript-url]
* [![NodeJs][NodeJs]][NodeJs-url]

## Levels
After each game I wrote the difficulty level of creation</br> 
$\color{#55AE5B}{{Easy}}$ - Easy mechanics, elementary behaviors are used, logic is simple, components are not complex</br>
$\color{#E3C678}{{Medium}}$ - Loops, behaviors are written manually, animations are linked to events, several complex components can be used</br>
$\color{#FF0000}{{Hard}}$ - Different ways to use storages, browsers etc, work with JS, interaction animation is must have, more that 10 layouts

## Games
### Run or die - $\color{#55AE5B}{{Easy}}$ 
A basic platformer with interesting traps and animations, there is also an enemy that will follow you.</br>
