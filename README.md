## Introduction 
Hi my name is Daniil, I am a developer specializing in different technologies, one of them is Construct.

Experience :
1. Constuct 3 Developer in Nomoc(Qlpaze) for one year.
2. Mentor of Constuct 2,3 in Eureka for 4 years, children 14-17 years old.

Other experience:
1. Java(Spring) + React developer for 4 months in NDA
2. Java(Core) + Js junior developer for 3 mounts in ProfItSoft


## Important
Each of the games follows this pattern:
1. Optimized for Android and iOS
2. Has localization in different languages ​​(usually 8)
3. Saving game progress at different stages
4. Using different plugins
5. The project architecture is clear
6. Adapted to different screens

All these games are commercial, they are still in development or customers have already received them

Usually the development of one project takes 3-5 months, sometimes there can be something easy, so it takes a month to fix the bugs, 
some games were developed or modified only by me, some in a team with developers.
